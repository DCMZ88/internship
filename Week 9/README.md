# Data Analysis

## Evaluation of VLMs on dataset (cont.)

**Aim** : Evaluate the dataset by generating the ground truth from different Object Detection models.

### Methodology
1. Using a VLM to generate the labels of the objects detected in the image.
2. To obtain the ground truth , we pass the labels through different models
3. If the label is correctly identified in all of the models, we classify that label as the ground truth
4. After obtaining the 'Ground Truths' from the various models, we then compare the original label generated by the VLM with the 'Ground Truth'.
5. We then calculate the precision and recall values of the VLM.

#### Information
VLM : Google's Gemma3-4b-it\
Object Detectors : GroundingDINO, Owlv2, OmDet\
Threshold value ( For all models ) : 0.25


 > I included each images' precision value in a `json` file.

### Challenges and Limitations
- One Limitation is that each 'Ground Truth' for each VLM wil be different due to the fact that the labels generated from the image might slightly differ.
- Some of the object detector models vary alot in determining the VLM's precision when the threshold value is set to 0.25.
### Results 

> Dataset consisted of 265 images

Google's Gemma-3-4b-it:
  - Precision ( GroundingDINO ) : 93.7%
  - Precision ( Owlv2 ) : 48.0%
  - Precision ( Omdet ) : 76.1%
> Threshold value (GroundingDINO) : 0.4 , Precision : 77.5%
# Research & Literature

## Precision - Recall 
Precision-Recall is a useful measure of success of prediction when the classes are very imbalanced. In information retrieval, precision is a measure of the fraction of relevant items among actually returned items while recall is a measure of the fraction of items that were returned among all items that should have been returned. ‘Relevancy’ here refers to items that are postively labeled, i.e., true positives and false negatives.

Precision is calculated by:

$$\frac{T_p}{T_p+F_p}$$

Recall is calculated by

$$\frac{T_p}{T_p+F_n}$$

where $T_p$ represents True Postives, $F_p$ represents False Postives, $F_n$ represents False Negatives
