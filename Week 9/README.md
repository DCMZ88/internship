# Data Analysis

## Evaluation of VLMs on Dataset (cont.)

**Aim** : Evaluate the dataset by generating the ground truth from different Object Detection models.

### Methodology
1. Using a VLM to generate the labels of the objects detected in the image.
2. To obtain the ground truth , we pass the labels through different models
3. If the label is correctly identified in all of the models, we classify that label as the ground truth
4. After obtaining the 'Ground Truths' from the various models, we then compare the original label generated by the VLM with the 'Ground Truth'.
5. We then calculate the precision and recall values of the VLM.

For this case, we will use Google's Gemma-3-4b-it and evaluate it. 

* I included each images' precision value in a `json` file.

### Challenges and Limitations
- One Limitation is that each 'Ground Truth' for each VLM wil be different due to the fact that the labels generated from the image might slightly differ.

### Results 

Dataset consisted of 265 images

Google's Gemma-3-4b-it:
  - Precision ( Overall ) : 77.5%
  - Recall ( Overall )
