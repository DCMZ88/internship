# Data Analysis

## Evaluation of the performance on VLMs ( cont. )

**Aim** : Evaluate other VLM's performance on object detection and obtain their precision score

**Methodology**

We use the same method in determining the precision scores as that in [Week 9](https://github.com/DCMZ88/internship/tree/main/Week%209), changing only the models used.

**Information**

Visual Language Models used: Qwen2.5-vl-
Zero-shot object detectors: GroundingDINO, OmDet, Owlv2
Threshold ( For object detection ) : 0.25
