## Research & Literature Review 
- Started on the basics of PyTorch models, learning what each line of code does
- Had many problems in setting up VSCode due to the restriction on TechNet
- Solve dependency and package issues for models on huggingface
- Set up the the environment to finally load and run models smoothly on JupyterLabs.
