# Progress for Week 2
## Learned how to process videos
Split videos frame by frame through use of OpenCV then loaded it through the OD-model to classify videos 
## Basics of CNN
i.e Structure of CNN : Convolution , Activation , MaxPooling e.t.c

## Challenges faced
- Kernel keeps dying whenever the model tries to process over a total of 1100 images 
  even though i tried to process it in batches of 50
- Unable to process long videos and gifs
- Unfamiliar with GitHub and all the processess before being able to code
  i.e setting up virtual environment
