# Intro to Machine Learning 
**Definition**: "Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." Arthur Samuel (1959)

## Types of Machine Learning 
### Supervised Learning (Main focus for internship)
- Algorithms which are trained on labelled data where each output has an associated output label 
- Applications : Classification , Regression
- Algorithms : Linear Regression , Neural Networks , Support Vector Machines  
### Unsupervised Learning
- Algorithms that are traine on unlabelled data so as to find patterns and relationships in the data itself 
- Applications : Clustering,Dimensionality Reduction
### Reinforcement Learning 
- Algorithms that learns by interactiing with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or punishments
- Applications : Robotics, Autonomous vehicles


## Supervised Learning (Algorithms)
### Linear Regression 
Aim: Makes a predicted output from infinetly many possible numbers
